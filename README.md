# Flappy Bird

A fun and simple p5.js + p5.play arcade style game where the player has to make the bird fly through the pipes so that the bird does not collide with them.

---

## How to Play

* Jump with the space key.
* Press over and over again to have the bird flap up.
* Don't collide with the pipes or the ground.
* You lose and reset when you collide with an obstacle.

## What I Learned

How to move an object using arrow keys, how to change or lower the height(of jump) and the size of the object. Collision and importing custom assets.
